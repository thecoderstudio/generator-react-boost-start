# React generator Boost-start
Out of the box this generator will create a solid React project up to modern day standards. You can choose to include several libraries and technologies we use
often at Code R. Just like the other generators in the Boost-start project, the generated project is up to the standards we prefer
at Code R, which may or may not align with yours.

## Usage
### Use within the Boost-start project

_Coming soon_

### Use seperately

1. Install with yarn:

```shell
yarn global add generator-react-boost-start
```

or with npm:

```shell
npm install -g generator-react-boost-start
```

2. `cd` where you want to create the project and run the generator:
```shell
yo react-boost-start
```

Do you have any ideas or have you spotted a bug? Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/thecoderstudio/boost-start/issues/new).
[Pull requests](https://github.com/thecoderstudio/boost-start/pulls) are also welcome although it should be noted this project is mainly
meant for usage within Code R and our workflow so a fork might be better suited.
